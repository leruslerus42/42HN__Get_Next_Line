# Get_Next_Line


Scope of the programm is to write a programm that will read a specific file available on the file descriptor, one line at the time until the end of it.

Our get next line function should return the line that has just been read, or NULL if there are no new lines available.

On top of that our programm should be able to handle bot the cases reading from a file or from the standard input.

To compile it should be used the flag: -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx, with x that could bbe a value between 1 and 10.000.
